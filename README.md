# CS-230-11444-M01 Operating Platforms - Spring 2025  
## Software Design Document: *Draw It or Lose It*  

### About  
This repository includes the completed software design document and supporting Java code for my final project in CS 230. The work here represents my understanding of how to design cross-platform software applications using both traditional and cloud environments. This semester, I’ve learned how to go beyond just writing code — thinking about system architecture, platform differences, and how to support real-world client needs through effective planning.

### Project Summary  
**Client:** The Gaming Room  
**Project:** Expand the Android-only game *Draw It or Lose It* into a web-based, multi-platform experience.  

The game is similar to the TV show *Win, Lose or Draw*, where teams guess a word or phrase based on visual clues. Our job was to design a scalable system supporting multiple teams, secure authentication, and consistent performance across browsers and devices. This included writing a software design document, platform analysis, and implementing object-oriented code using Java.

### What I Did Well  
- Successfully implemented the **singleton** and **iterator** design patterns in the `GameService` class.  
- Built a clear system for avoiding duplicate game, team, and player names.  
- Wrote a detailed, professional-grade **Software Design Document** to guide client decisions.

### What I Would Improve  
Early on, I confused **requirements** with **constraints**, and I didn't fully explain platform-specific limitations in the Design Constraints section. After reviewing the rubric and announcements, I went back and reworked those sections. In the future, I’ll pay closer attention to what each section is actually asking for to avoid repeating those mistakes.

### What Helped Me the Most in Code  
The UML diagram and planning process helped me understand the relationships between objects before I started writing code. Structuring logic into small methods made it easier to test and debug. Starting with design made the code more purposeful.

---

### Meeting User Needs  
Everything I wrote was based on the user needs:  
- Unique names for teams and games  
- One game instance in memory at a time  
- Cross-platform support  
- Scalable storage for images and users  

This project helped me realize that good software design is about **solving problems for people**, not just writing code that compiles.

---

### Future Strategy  
In future projects, I’ll:
- Start with clear diagrams and pseudocode  
- Think early about scalability, performance, and hosting  
- Use proven design patterns  
- Write documents that communicate clearly with nontechnical stakeholders
